1 cup of coffee with 15 g heavy cream
48 g pork jowl bacon
5 g quinoa
5 g chia
4 g nopalina
29 g spinach
146 g whole egg (3 large)

2 big sausages
85 g broccoli slaw

I've not done any exercise today. I've got room in my calorie budget for 2 more of the sugar-free caramels. That will leave me a few grams short on protein.
Because my Rangers are on the west coast tonight, I might decide to do some cardio while watching, giving me more room for more protein. Maybe not. I'm at 5% carbs so far."
