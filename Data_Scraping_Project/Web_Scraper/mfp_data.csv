avskk,"October 24, 2018 2:32PM","Autumn has fully arrived and I'm cooking about it.
Breakfast:
toaster waffles with yogurt butter and syrup, fried ham, coffee.
Lunch:
leftover chili with cheese, sour cream, and a few corn chips. I'm having a fairly small portion of this (it's... not at all ""light""), so if I'm still hungry I'll have some broccoli, baby carrots, and cherry tomatoes.
Dinner:
leftover vegetable-loaded chicken-tortellini soup.
Snacks:
clementines, grapes, or pomegranate."
janejellyroll,"October 24, 2018 2:37PM","Breakfast:
Chinese sticky rice with tempeh sausage, cucumber salad
Lunch
: Going out to lunch with co-workers . . . probably a black bean burger with guacamole and some fruit salad
Dinner:
Lettuce, basil, mint, and radishes with Thai-style dressing, sweet potato stew
I love autumn cooking! I just got some butternut squash in my CSA box so I'm thinking about what I want to do with them this weekend (thinking maybe roasted butternut squash risotto)."
firlena227,"October 24, 2018 4:07PM","Ooh I love butternut squash risotto (apart from the chopping up the butternut squash part!!) Haven't made it for ages, that's definitely going on my next week's menu
Breakfast: crumpets, banana.
Lunch: cheese & shallot toastie, apple
Dinner: jacket potato & beans.
Not the most inspiring food day today!"
amy19355,"November 2, 2018 3:30PM","Can of low sodium chicken
with wild rice soup, with an added 1/2 cup of brown rice and a side of crunchy raw organic carrots."
Sunshine_And_Sand,"November 2, 2018 3:38PM","Breakfast - zoats with melted American cheese and salt and pepper
Lunch - Amy's organic tortilla casserole and black beans microwave dinner with the rest of the zucchini from breakfast mixed in for added volume
Dinner - 1 oz pasta with roasted orange bell pepper, steamed corn and/or peas if I have them, and about an ounce of shredded cheese. Side of steamed asparagus (I buy the microwave steam in bag asparagus and DH and I usually eat a whole bag each ðŸ˜¬)
Snacks - not sure yet... thinking of trying an angel food cake recipe I found yesterday"
avskk,"November 2, 2018 4:42PM","Today's going to be a good, if carby, day, I think.
Breakfast:
about 2/3 of a carrot muffin (AMAZING), cottage cheese with peach Bellini jam, coffee.
Lunch:
will be turkey and cheddar sandwiches on green-chili sourdough (DOUBLE AMAZING), and I suspect I will also eat at least one slice of the bread topped with a thin slice of cheese; baby carrots and cherry tomatoes on the side.
Dinner:
either leftover Spanish rice with chickpeas, artichoke hearts, and greens... or, let's be honest, more fancy bread, cheese, and turkey with a token side of green beans or broccoli."
MelanieCN77,"November 3, 2018 2:00PM","Breakfast: home made plain yoghurt with blueberries, strawberries and a handful of Kashi granola, two cups of coffee
Post run snack: bunch of tangerines
Lunch: Sausage and bell peppers baked in the oven, and a pita. I might add some sweet potato, we'll see.
Snacks: out and about so tub with carrots, cheese, grapes, nuts, crackers
Dinner: I'm getting home on the late side so if I'm crazy hungry I might pick something up and to hell with the cals today. Been thinking about a tostada salad and a quesadilla from El Pollo Loco all week lol. Or if I make it home with my discipline intact, some microwave rice, frozen gyoza and broccoli.
Late night munchies: all week instead of Halo Top or whatever, because it's been colder, been enjoying a little bowl of sliced apples, walnuts or cashews, couple chunks parmesan and some crackers."
nicsflyingcircus,"November 3, 2018 4:31PM","Breakfast: the Protein Plate at our local diner. 4 scrambled eggs, 3 pieces of bacon, 2 slices of Canadian bacon. I could only eat half the eggs, lol.
Supper: Grilled cheese (on cauliflower sandwich thins), stuffed full with garlic and pepper ham, a little bacon, provolone and cheddar. Nice big salad with balsamic vinaigrette."
MelanieCN77,"November 3, 2018 5:10PM",OK well my nice plan went out the window. I'm having a 10am roast beef sandwich and crackers. The runger is real.
rainingribbons,"November 3, 2018 8:01PM","Breakfast: 2 homemade cinnamon rolls
Morning snack: another cinnamon roll.
Late lunch/early dinner: roast, baked mac and cheese, mashed potatoes with a smidgen of mushroom gravy, and grilled green beans. Probably also a beer.
Dessert: Might have a slice of vanilla raspberry cake - without the icing.
Cheat day today and part of tomorrow, as the bf and I are away for the weekend staying with friends. Gunna get back on track Monday!"
seltzermint555,"November 4, 2018 3:16AM","It's my birthday, so I ate all of the things and ok with that!
Breakfast: 8 oz. peach noosa yogurt (I usually eat half) and black coffee
Lunch: bento box (Japanese restaurant) with sushi & tempura vegetables and 1 cup sake
Mid-afternoon: Starbucks venti iced Americano & an extra shot of espresso
Dinner: bowl of French onion soup and 1/2 toasted chicken salad sandwich (another restaurant so all very creamy, buttery, a nightmare calorie-wise I am sure)
Dessert: a big slice of the huge chocolate chip cookie my husband made for me, with Roastaroma tea
When I type it all out, it doesn't sound nearly as crazy as it felt to me."

avskk,"November 13, 2018 4:32PM","I had a killer breakfast this morning -- I cubed and quick-fried a leftover baked potato in a little yogurt butter with various spices, fried a couple of eggs over-medium and put them on top, and basically achieved enlightenment. I rarely have time to really cook breakfast, so it was super nice on a random Tuesday!"
MelanieCN77,"November 13, 2018 4:48PM","I've been hoarding calories for dessert/after dinner snacks since I started, I try to be more even but I find the fullness at the end of the day comforting. Now it's cooling off, my Halo Top and cookies combos have turned into something different. Sliced up honeycrisp apple, couple chunks of parmesan, couple of walnuts and a serving of TJ's multigrain crackers. Ugh so good."
